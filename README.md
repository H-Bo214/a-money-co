## üóìPlanning and challenges

I began planning by reviewing the API documentation provided by Fixer Currency. The purpose of the application was fairly straight forward, provide conversion rates based on a specific amount. This project didn't present many technical challenges regarding data retrieval. However, I was faced with stylistic challenges mostly in regards to adding images within the select input in a dynamic way. After reviewing React-Select documentation as well as other online resources I was able to find a solution. Throughout the project, I reviewed and refactored several parts of my code in order to minimize the size of certain components.
